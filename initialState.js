Fernanda got what I wanted very quickly and, unlike other realtors in the past, she only showed me apartments within my budget that I would be interested in. She was always very responsive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile. She also helped my sister, who lived our of state, find her perfect place. I've already recommended her to everyone I know is looking for a place!",

        "testimonial":"I had just received a job offer in NYC. I had no idea about the process of renting an apartment in the city. ( I come from South Americs) Maria has helped us tremendously finding an apartment in NYC. She made us the favour of going to see the apartments in our behalf and provided us with feedbacks. She helped us with very useful recommendations about the buildings were the apartments were located, as well as with the neighborhood and its surroundings. She also helped us with the payments ( logistics of paying from an foreign country) and guarantor alternatives. She is very responsive and gives her 100% when working with you.",
