            In just two days of visiting apartments we found the perfect place for me, and under my budget! Fernanda got what I wanted very quickly and, unlike other realtors in the past, she only showed me apartments within my budget that I would be interested in. She was always very responsive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile. She also helped my sister, who lived our of state, find her perfect place. I've already recommended her to everyone I know is looking for a place!
