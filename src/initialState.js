( I come from South Americs) Maria has helped us tremendously finding an apartment in NYC. She made us the favour of going to see the apartments in our behalf and provided us with feedbacks. She helped us with very useful recommendations about the buildings were the apartments were located, as well as with the neighborhood and its surroundings. She also helped us with the payments ( logistics of paying from an foreign country) and guarantor alternatives. She is very responsive and gives her 100% when working with you.",
