            In just two days of visiting apartments we found the perfect place
            for me, and under my budget! Fernanda got what I wanted very quickly
            and, unlike other realtors in the past, she only showed me
            apartments within my budget that I would be interested in. She was
            always very responsive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile.
            She also helped my sister, who lived our of state, find her perfect
            place. I've already recommended her to everyone I know is looking
            for a place!
